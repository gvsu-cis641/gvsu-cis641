# Plagiarism Policy

## What does plagiarism and cheating mean?

Thanks for asking!  If I see or catch plagiarism/cheating I can guarantee that you will regret it.  If you are lucky I will warn you, however there is no guarantee that I will do so.  

### Plagiarism:

Copying/pasting others ideas without attribution/distillation.  If you read an article, watch a video, use a book, basically anything outside of the course slides, you should reference the author and where you got the information from.  Rote copy/pasting is not allowed.  I am interested in what you have learned, not that you know how to copy from other sources.

For additional reference: [GVSU Plagiarism Policy](https://www.gvsu.edu/istudents/plagiarism-72.htm) and [GVSU Computing Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm).

(Not sure why this is limited to IS, it is applicable to everybody).

### Cheating:

If I tell you that you must submit an assignment individually, that means that I don't want to see multiple copies of the same submission.  You must write down your own ideas and do your own work.  Generally I don't mind if you work together on an assignment, but there should be a clear distinction in submissions.
