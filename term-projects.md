# Term Project Expectations

One thing to keep in mind is that I will be keeping an eye on your commit history, watching your interactions, keeping tabs, etc.  Ensure that you put in an equal amount of effort!  If you are the type of student that lets your team members do all the work, expect your grade to be scaled appropriately.

Your **overall task** is to create a functioning product that uses the techniques we talk about in class.  Your project deliverables will approximately follow what we're talking about in class.

## Project Responsibilities

1. Form a project team and decide on your project.
2. Setup a GitHub repository for your team (you'll fork my [starter repository](https://github.com/gvsu-cis641/base)).
  * At this point, you will start having weekly meetings **and** checking in your minutes to your repository.
  * Minutes are still **required** even if you are a team of one - use them to keep yourself on topic.
4. Create an initial Software Requirements Specification and CRC cards.
5. Develop a functioning prototype // minimum viable product.
6. Present your progress about halfway through the semester.
7. Iterate your requirements and develop supporting software models.
8. Present your final product at the end of the semester.
9. Evaluate your teammates at the end of the semester

## Project Examples

Your team has the option to choose whatever project you wish to work on (pending approval and scoping, naturally).  Note: you can use *whatever* language you want.  Feel free to use pre-existing libraries and/or development environments (e.g., Mendix, Unity, Godot, RPGMaker, etc.) to get you going - the focus is on the **process**.  However, if you have no pre-defined expectations of what you want to work on then this list may be helpful to get you thinking:

* Pixel art phone application
* 2D adventure game
* Google Calendar clone
* Warehouse inventory web application
* Note-taking web application
* Christmas lights controller
* ML-driven insect identification 
* E-commerce website
* Library management system
* Sushi eating guide phone application
* University messaging web application
* Pac-Man Java clone
* Faculty management system
* Scientific calculator application 
* Ride-sharing application
* Patient/doctor interaction application
* Unity-based vehicle configurator

*Note - the following list is from CIS350 to give you additional inspiration* :

### Games

* Roguelike
* Procedurally-generated 2D space game
* Role-playing games
* 2D platformer
* 2D shmup
* Halo clone with multiplayer
* Text adventure
* Interactive fiction
* 1st-person horror VR 

### Non-games

* Crypto tracker
* Cloud-based pentesting suite
* Disc golf finder (Arduino + RFID)
* Sensor monitor (Rasperry Pi + sensors + display)
* Fitness tracker
* Hiking tracker

## Project Tips

* Ensure you pick something achievable for your team.  For example, if nobody has any Python experience it might not make sense to write your project in Python.  Conversely, if there is something you *really want to learn* then this might be a good opportunity to do that.  Just ensure that you scope your project appropriately (e.g., don't shoot for an MMO if you've never written networking code before).
* Pick a project that *you've always wanted to work on, but never have had time to do that*.  I view this project as a forced push to do something interesting.  I don't know about you, but I tend to start projects and never finish them unless I have a forced deadline.
* Be proud of what you've worked on - ideally this will be part of your project portfolio that you can show off to future employers.
* If you are using starter code, libraries, tutorials, etc., ensure that you cite your source in your project documentation.
* **DO NOT** simply clone/copy someone else's project (either from this class or the Internet) and call it your own without significant iteration.  For example, you can use the Unity tutorials or microgame starters as long as you **significantly extend** them.
* Keep up with your weekly meetings and keep in contact with your teammates.  If you wait until a deadline it is going to be *significantly* more stressful than if you make progress throughout the semester.
* I will not be micromanaging your projects - that is up to your teams.  If you are not making appropriate progress then that will be reflected in your grade!

## Weekly Meetings

Each week your team is required to meet (except where otherwise noted) and to create and submit a Meeting Minutes document.  I have a [template](https://github.com/gvsu-cis641/base/tree/master/meetings) in the project start repository for you to fill out.  Ensure you check in your minutes by each week's due date.

## Team Member Issues

No matter how much you try, there will inevitably be friction on project teams.  *Interestingly enough - this carries over to industry - learning how to work together and have open discussions is a critical skill that will help you throughout your career*.  If you are struggling with your team and/or teammates, here are a few tips to help:

* **Communicate! Talk to each other!**  Even if you're mad, upset, frustrated, express your issues.  If you silently fume, shut down, or just stop participating then nothing will be solved.
* If you are in a rough emotional state, save your message/email until you are ready to talk openly.  Don't let anger or frustration force problems to become worse.
* Check out this [Team Communication](https://asana.com/resources/team-communication) page to get some external suggestions.
* If all else fails, email me or schedule an appointment.  I will try to help mediate and work to solve your issues.  If you wait until the last possible day in the semester then there is nothing I can do.  If you talk to me earlier then I can help.
