## Overview

The purpose of this activity is threefold:

1. To gain an understanding of recent academic research in the domain of Systems Analysis and Design (which oddly corresponds to Software Engineering).
2. To gain the skills to read and *understand* academic research papers.
3. To practice your presentation skills.

**Note**: if there is a paper that you *really* want to present to the class, please let me know ahead of time and I can work it into the schedule.  There are some fascinating papers out there!  If there is a topic you are particularly interested in I recommend searching for it on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com){:target="_blank"}.

## Everyone

1. Read the paper for the week.
2. Come to class prepared to discuss the key points.

---

## Presenters

1. Read the paper multiple times (it will help).
2. Fill out the [paper template](../assets/docs/CIS641-Paper-Review-Template.docx) and submit to [Blackboard](https://lms.gvsu.edu){:target="_blank"} **prior to the start of class on the day of your presentation**.
3. If you are presenting in a group, discuss the order of presentation prior to class and which parts each person will be presenting.  Essentially, I want you to distill your thoughts and not simply read your template.
