## Learning Objectives

This course is intended to be a managerial level viewpoint of the entire systems development life cycle. As such, its primary objective is to introduce/expose the students to the various lifecycle approaches existing in industry and to the fundamental work products of each phase of the typical, or generic lifecycle. The goal of this course is to prepare the student for a leadership role in systems development. Upon completion of this course, the students should have a fundamental understanding of how to:

* Analyze the business needs that drive the need for IS solutions.
* Compare and contrast stakeholder roles in IS development.
* Explain a typical IS project lifecycle.
* Evaluate and choose appropriate system development lifecycles and methodologies.
* Evaluate and choose appropriate systems acquisition alternatives.
* Illustrate quality assurance and security concerns faced in all phases of systems development.
* Analyze a business process and create a high-level design specification.
* Analyze and articulate ethical, cultural, and legal issues associated with systems development.

## Lecture

This class has *two* sections.  For both, we will meet in person.  Typically class will comprise a lecture, a research paper presentation, discussion, and some in-class assignments sprinkled throughout.  These are due the **next day by 11:59pm**.  Ensure you keep up on these, as they factor into the Participation part of your grade.  

**Note**: I will not accept late in-class assignment submissions - no exceptions.

## Textbook

The textbook for this class is **required**!

**Systems Analysis and Design: An Object-Oriented Approach with UML. Dennis, Wixom, and Tegarden.  Sixth edition.**
ISBN: 978-1-119-55991-7

*Note*: older editions *should* be fine, though I've been told that the newest edition has the cheapest options available for purchase/rent.

Each week I will assign readings and will sporadically assign problems from the textbook (problems will be mirrored in Blackboard if you're worried about version).  Please keep up with the readings as they will go a long way to contextualizing what we discuss in class!

### READ THIS!

To save costs, I signed up for the GVSU SAVE program with the GVSU Bookstore.  This means that you are auto-charged for the book, however it is (in theory) offered at a significant cost savings.  You are allowed to **opt-out** if you wish to purchase the book yourself from another location, however you need to manually opt out.  

**The deadline to opt-out is Friday, September 9th**.

To opt-out, visit this page: [https://lakerstore.gvsu.edu/gvsusave](https://lakerstore.gvsu.edu/gvsusave){:target="_blank"} and follow the instructions.

## Research Paper Presentations

Each student will need to present **at least one** research paper prior to the end of the semester.  It is your responsibility to sign up for a paper - if you do not sign up you will lose a significant amount of points in the course.

Research papers will reflect the topic of the week.  Typically there will be more than one student presenting, so please decide on your ordering prior to class.

Your individual responsibilities include:

* Reading and understanding an academic research paper.
* Filling out a template with key points regarding the paper.
* Presenting the paper to the class and answering questions regarding the paper.

All assignments are due by 11:59pm on the date they are due.  Please check Blackboard regularly for upcoming due dates.  If you are struggling or are having problems, please contact me in advance.  If you message me or email me the night something is due I will most likely not accept your reasoning.  If you get in touch early then we can work it out.
